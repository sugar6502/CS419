transition studies and skin friction measurements on an insulated flat plate at a mach number of . . an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated flat plate,  by  in., was made in the galcit  by  in. hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of . . the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition detection and was found to be in good agreement with total head rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary  layer surveys .  it was found that the boundary layer was laminar at reynolds numbers of at least  x  .  transverse contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading edge at reynolds numbers of . to  x , and spread at a uniform angle of  compared to  degree in low speed flow . the effect of two dimensional and local disturbances was investigated .  the technique of air injection into the boundary layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used . although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers as low as , a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was not obtained at reynolds numbers much below  x  regardless of the amount of air injected . a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds . direct skin friction measurements were made by means of the floating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers verified as being laminar over the complete range .  with air injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds numbers greater than  x , this value being in good agreement with earlier results of this investigation .  the turbulent skin friction coefficient was found to be approximately . of that for incompressible flow for a constant value of r, and . for an effective reynolds number between  and  x  .
